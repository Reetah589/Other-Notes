    <h2>What Is NaNoWriMo</h2>
        <p>A global writing marathon where writers commit to creating a 50,000 word novel within 
            the span of 30 days. There is an annual event in the month of November every year called 
            National Novel Writing Month which sees thousands of participants every year.       
        </p>
    <h2>The Rules of NaNoWriMo</h2>
        <p>Yes there are rules during the event but if doing at home they serve as helpful guidlines 
            to follow. On the first day at midnight begin drafting and attempt to finish by day 30. 
            The writers are more than welcome to plan and outline before they begin on the first day. 
            Write an average of 1,667 words per day.
        </p>
    <h2>Why NaNoWriMo Helps With Your Writing</h2>
        <p>Having a challenge can help push us to finally write that novel we have been thinking about 
            or building. Writing a novel can be a very frustrating process and looking for ways to get it 
            done can be exhausting and also time consuming. Being presented with a challenge where the 
            only rule is to write on day 1 and finish on day 30 with an outline and planning already 
            completed beforehand helps.
